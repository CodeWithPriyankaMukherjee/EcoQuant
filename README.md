## üöÄ Overview
#### EcoQuant (EQT) is a decentralized financial ecosystem built on the Celo Sepolia Testnet, designed to enable transparent and traceable carbon credit verification, tokenization, and investment.

#### We introduce EcoQuant Tokens (EQT) ‚Äî an ERC-20 fungible token that represents verified carbon offsets. Our system bridges the gap between contributors (project developers who generate carbon offsets) and investors (individuals or institutions who wish to support sustainable initiatives or trade in carbon markets), creating a climate-positive financial loop.

## üåç Why It Matters
#### The world‚Äôs carbon markets suffer from opacity, double counting, and lack of verification, making it difficult for sustainable projects to receive fair valuation and funding.

EcoQuant tackles this challenge by:

- Tokenizing verified carbon projects directly on-chain.

- Ensuring full transparency of transactions and project authenticity.

- Creating incentives for green investment through a decentralized liquidity ecosystem.

By turning carbon offsets into verifiable, tradable tokens, we‚Äôre transforming climate accountability into a tangible financial incentive, empowering individuals and organizations to take part in the global mission toward Net Zero.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
#### 1. Contributor Dashboard

- Contributors upload and submit their carbon offset projects.

- They draw polygon shapes on a geo-mapped interface to mark the project location.

- The system uses ML-based prediction to suggest the amount of EQT tokens to be minted for each project.

#### 2. Admin Verification & Minting

- Admin reviews submissions and approves verified projects.

- EQT tokens are minted based on project type and ML predictions.

- Each project‚Äôs metadata and proof are stored on IPFS for immutable verification.

#### 3. Blockchain Integration

- Minted EQTs are recorded on the Celo Sepolia chain.

- All transactions are publicly viewable for full transparency.

#### 4. Investor Dashboard

- Investors can invest in specific projects, or Trade EQT tokens via the liquidity pool.

- Using the Ubeswap V3 protocol, investors can swap Celo tokens for EQT and add liquidity to the pool ‚Äî supporting the ecosystem and earning returns.

#### 5. Transparency Layer

- Every transaction, investment, and token activity is visible on the investor dashboard.

- Ensures trust, traceability, and climate accountability.
## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18.x or higher
- **npm:** Version 9.x or higher  
- **Git:** For cloning the repository

```bash
# Verify your environment
node --version    # Should be 18.x or higher
npm --version     # Should be 9.x ++
git --version
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theskepticgeek/EcoQuant.git
cd EcoQuant
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install main project dependencies
npm install

# Install Privy authentication (if not already included)
npm install @privy-io/react-auth@latest

# Install Hardhat globally (if needed)
npm install -g hardhat
```
### 3. Hardhat Setup & Smart Contract Configuration

#### Since this project uses Hardhat for smart contract interactions and backend processing, you need to set it up in the main directory:
```bash
# Initialize Hardhat (if not already present)
npx hardhat init

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests to verify everything works
npx hardhat test

```

    Note: Hardhat must be properly set up in the main directory as the backend depends on the compiled contracts and ABI files for NFT minting functionality.
### 4. Environment Configuration
#### Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory with your own API Keys:
```bash
# Privy Authentication
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=

# Pinata IPFS Configuration
VITE_PINATA_API_KEY=
VITE_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=
VITE_PINATA_JWT=

# Blockchain Configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=
POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL=

# Test Configuration
RECIPIENT=
AMOUNT=
IPFS_HASH=
```

## Running the Application
### You need to run two servers simultaneously:
### Terminal 1 - Frontend (Root Directory)
```bash
# From the main project directory
npm run dev
```
### Terminal 2 - Backend Server
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Start the backend server
node server.cjs
```
#### Backend API will be available at: ```http://localhost:3001```

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues:
#### 1. Hardhat Compilation Error:
```bash
# Clear cache and recompile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile
```
#### 2. Dependency Issues:
```bash
# Clear and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm install @privy-io/react-auth@latest
```
#### 3. Port Conflicts
##### Step 1: Kill all ports
```bash
# Kill processes on commonly used ports
npx kill-port 5173  # Vite frontend
npx kill-port 3001  # Backend API
npx kill-port 8545  # Hardhat node
npx kill-port 3000  # Alternative frontend port
```
##### Step 2: After killing ports, restart the servers:
###### Terminal 1:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Restart frontend
npm run dev
```
###### Terminal 2:
```bash
# Terminal 2 - Restart backend
cd backend
node server.cjs
```
##### Step 3: Change Vite Port Configuration:
###### Option 1: Command line flag
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```
###### Option 2: Update vite.config.js
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,  // Change to port 3000
    host: true   // Optional: allows external access
  }
})
```

## Verification Checklist
##### All dependencies installed (npm install completed without errors)

##### Hardhat compiled successfully (npx hardhat compile)

##### Environment variables set in .env file

##### Frontend server running (check terminal for actual port)

##### Backend server running (check terminal for actual port)

##### MetaMask connected to Polygon Amoy testnet

##### Test MATIC available in wallet

##### No port conflicts between frontend and backend
